    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Aaliyah Phommatham-P and I am a junior at Mount Eden High School. I had always had an interest in coding especially since my uncle's would introduce it to me often. So I thought joining this class would be a good opportunity to learn more. Even though this year has definitely been tough and pretty confusing I was still able to push through the struggles. In the beginning of the year I knew pretty much nothing about coding but I feel like as the year is coming to the end I was able to learn as much as I was able to obtain throughout the struggles.
