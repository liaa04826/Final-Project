#  Aaliyah's Personal Portfolio – Final Project

## About Me

Hi! My name is **Aaliyah Phommatham-P**, and I’m currently a junior at Mount Eden High School. I’ve always had an interest in coding, especially since my uncles introduced me to it at a young age. I joined this Computer Science class to explore that interest further and learn how to create real projects using code.

This school year has definitely been challenging—at times confusing—but I’m proud that I pushed through. At the beginning, I barely knew anything about coding. But by the end of the year, I feel confident in how much I’ve learned and how far I’ve come. From building simple web pages to creating interactive JavaScript games, I’ve grown a lot as a beginner programmer.

## 💡 What I Learned This Year

This year, I learned how to:

- Write HTML and CSS to design visually appealing websites  
- Use JavaScript to create interactivity and logic in games  
- Debug problems and fix errors in my code  
- Use GitHub to host and publish my work online  

Even though it was hard at times, I’m proud of how much I accomplished and I’m excited to keep learning more!
